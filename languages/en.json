	"CHALLENGE.LVL.2": "Two types of vehicles will be allowed to compete according to two regulations. The Prototypes, lightand aerodynamic, have been built to optimise energetic efficiency. The UrbanConcepts, in addition to this low-consumption aspect, must respect some other constraints to look like production vehicles. They will have to race on three different challenges, the Short-Run, the Long-Run and the Slalom. The Short-Run is a race of regularity on five laps. The competitors must respect a speed and each difference will be penalised. The Long-Run is a two-hour-long-distance race. The aim is to demonstrate the efficiency of the cars by covering the longest distance with a limited amount of energy. Two or three pilots will take turns during this challenge. Strategic choices have to be done in order to win. Finally, pilots will compete in the Slalom challenge to show the handiness of their vehicles. Different prices will reward teams on some aspects (communication, innovation, security, perseverance, diversity, and animation)",
